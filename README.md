# Diebetes-Prediction-ML-Model
Developed a diabetes prediction ML model using features like glucose, blood pressure, BMI, and age. Analyzed data, trained an SVC with a linear kernel, achieved high accuracy, and saved the model using pickle. Created a Streamlit-based UI for user-friendly health predictions.
