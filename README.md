# Diebetes-Prediction-ML-Model
Developed a diabetes prediction ML model using features like glucose, blood pressure, BMI, and age. Analyzed data, trained an SVC with a linear kernel, achieved high accuracy, and saved the model using pickle. Created a Streamlit-based UI for user-friendly health predictions.
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a machine learning model built on a dataset containing features like glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, and age. The dataset was analyzed for statistical insights, missing values, and feature distributions. After preprocessing, it was split into training and testing sets for evaluation.

A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel was used to train the model, achieving high accuracy. Predictions were validated to ensure the model's reliability and efficiency in identifying diabetes.

The trained model was saved using the pickle library for deployment. An interactive user interface was developed using Streamlit, allowing users to input health data and instantly receive diabetes predictions. This user-friendly interface demonstrates the model's practical application in healthcare.

This project highlights skills in data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment, providing a scalable solution for diabetes prediction.
